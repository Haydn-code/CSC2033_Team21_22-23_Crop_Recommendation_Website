###GDAL Install
#####Windows
In order for this project to work as intended GDAL needs to be installed. However, pip cannot install this like other 
packages so follow the instructions in this video to get GDAL working for your computer. You can use the terminal in
pycharm for the to pip install the wheel instead of creating a conda environment like it does in the video, this makes 
sure GDAL is installed in your venv folder. The website this video recommends you to is no longer available, however the
packages can be downloaded from this webpage instead, just use ctrl+f and search gdal to find them.
